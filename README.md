# Save-the-Bunny 
-Project Description-
"Save the Bunny" is a mobile game that requires players to control a rabbit character, helping it avoid falling spikes while attempting to stay alive for as long as possible. While the spikes are a danger to the rabbit, carrots also fall from the sky, which provide points to the player and help the rabbit progress to the next level. The player's primary objective is to keep the rabbit character alive while collecting as many carrots as possible to gain points and advance through the game's levels.
